# Hiragana Prediction

![Example](./docs/example.png)

Tensorflow project for predicting hiragana characters.

---

The model is trained from fonts (WIP), these are saved into image maps through `make scrape`. Found out about the `MNIST` dataset after building this ðŸ™ƒ.

`make train` - Train the model based on scraped fonts

`make api` - Start a flask server that runs predictions

`make client` - Start the canvas application
